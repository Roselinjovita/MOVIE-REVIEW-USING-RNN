# MOVIE-REVIEW-USING-RNN


# ðŸŽ¬ RNN-Based Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of IMDb movie reviews. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Dataset**: IMDb movie reviews (built into Keras)
- **Model**: Simple RNN using Embedding, SimpleRNN, and Dense layers
- **Task**: Sentiment classification (Positive or Negative)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit Web App
- **Output**: Web interface for users to input reviews and get predictions

## ðŸ’» How to Run This Project Locally

### âœ… 1. Clone or Download the Project

Place these files in a folder (e.g., `rnn_sentiment_analysis`):

- `RNN.ipynb` â€” notebook to train the model
- `app.py` â€” Streamlit application (youâ€™ll create this)
- After running the notebook, you'll generate:
  - `model.h5`
  - `tokenizer.pickle`
